- Page title updates

## How to Test

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/globe` or click "Globe" in the navigation
3. Try different data types from the dropdown
4. Interact with the globe (drag, zoom, click points)
5. Test the controls (reset view, auto-rotation)

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with TypeScript
- **3D Library**: Globe.GL (Three.js based)
- **APIs**: USGS Earthquake API, OpenWeatherMap API
- **Styling**: CSS with modern effects (backdrop-filter, gradients)
- **State Management**: Vue reactive state
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with fallback data

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data updates
- More data sources (traffic, pollution, etc.)
- Custom data point styling based on data type
- Export functionality
- Time-based data visualization
